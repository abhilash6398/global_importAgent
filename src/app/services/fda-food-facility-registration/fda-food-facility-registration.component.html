              <img src="./assets/images/fda_approved.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;">

              <p>U.S. regulations mandates that all U.S. and foreign facilities that process, pack or hold human or animal food for consumption in the U.S. <b>MUST</b> register with the FDA as a Foreign Food Facility. Where a foreign food facility does not have a US customer, or importer, who is willing to take responsibility the foreign supplier is also required to appoint an agent in the U.S. to serve as a point of contact for FDA. US Import Agent will serve as this point of contact for you and we can register you with the FDA and Liaise with them on your behalf.</p>

              <p>Once Registered, we will provide you with a documented proof of registration along with your registration number. This may be used with customs brokers, importers and others to demonstrate that your facility is properly registered.  Your registration number <b>MUST</b> be included in Prior Notice filings before you begin importing your product to the US.</p>

              <p><b>The Food Safety Modernisation (FSMA) </b> Act requires all food facilities to re-register with FDA on every even-numbered year. Once we register you we will upkeep your biennial registration for you and act as your point of contact for the FDA.</p>

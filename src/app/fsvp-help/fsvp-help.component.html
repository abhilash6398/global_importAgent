                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: block;">
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>The Foreign Supplier Verification Program or FSVP is a US food safety law concerning food and beverage produce being imported into the United States.</li>
                                      <li> FSVP came into force  May 30, 2017, under the Food Safety modernisation Act (FSMA). After a seemingly endless amount of recalls, listeria outbreaks and general food safety issues, the decision was made to overhaul the way the US enforces food safety. </li>

                                    <li>FSVP is concerned with foreign suppliers (food and beverage businesses that export produce to the US) and how they manage the food safety of their products. FSVP was put in place to make sure that any food produce imported to the US is produced to the same standard that American food companies are held to. </li>

                                  </ul>

                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: none;">
                                 <p>FSVP is mandated by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).  A major point of the law is that the same preventive food safety standards apply to food consumed in the U.S., regardless of where the food is produced.</p>
                                  <p>FSVP requires importers to verify that their foreign suppliers of food for human and animal consumption meet applicable FDA safety standards. More specifically, FSVP requires that importers verify  their suppliers are producing food using processes and procedures that offer the same level of public health protection as the preventive controls (PC) requirements in the preventive controls and current good manufacturing practices rules for human food and animal food and produce safety FSMA rules, and that the food is not adulterated and properly labelled with respect to US regulation.</p>

                              <div class="fs-acc-title">When Did FSVP Come into Force?</div>
                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: none;">
                                 <p>FSVP came into force May 30, 2017, with multiple different dates depending on the type of business. It is important to note the compliance dates for FSVP are not based on the size of the importer. Instead, the compliance dates are staggered based on the size of the foreign supplier and the regulations that apply to the foreign supplier. The first compliance date was eighteen months after the FSVP final rule was published in the Federal Register. This date gave importers sufficient time to understand the rule and develop their FSVPs.</p>
                                  <p>FSVP compliance dates were linked to other FSMA rules as the FDA wanted to minimize the likelihood that an importer would be required to comply with the FSVP regulation before its supplier is required to comply with other FSMA food safety regulations.</p>

                              <div class="fs-acc-title">Who Has to be in Compliance With FSVP?</div>
                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: none;">
                                <p>U.S. importers subject to this first compliance date have foreign suppliers that fall into one of three categories:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>The Foreign Supplier Verification Program or FSVP is a US food safety law concerning food and beverage produce being imported into the United States.</li>
                                      <li>Foreign suppliers that will not be covered by the PC or produce safety rules; </li>

                                    <li>Foreign suppliers subject to the PC for Human Food rule and are not  “small businesses,” “qualified facilities” (certain very small businesses) or subject to the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance; or </li>
                                      <li>Foreign suppliers subject to the current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) requirements in the PC for Animal Food rule, and are not “small businesses” or “qualified facilities”.</li>

                                  </ul>
                                  <p>If you are still unsure where you fit into this picture, the FDA released a chart to help clarify who needs to do what, the "Am I Subject to FSVP?”  is for importers to refer to if they are unsure which the rule applies to them and their specific product.</p>
                              </div>
                          </div>

                              <div class="fs-acc-title">What Do Importers Have to Verify Under FSVP?</div>
                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: none;">
                                <p>Importers covered by the FSVP rule have to verify that their suppliers meet applicable FDA food safety requirements, including that the food is not adulterated or mis-branded with respect to allergens.

</p>
                                  <p>Importers do have some flexibility with respect to the preventative controls (PC) and produce safety rules. Importers need to have a program that allows them to demonstrate that their foreign suppliers are producing food in a manner that provides the same level of public health protection as the PC or produce rules.</p>
                                  <p>However, importers will have additional time to develop and implement FSVPs for foods from smaller suppliers that are considered qualified facilities or small businesses under the PC rules, as well for food subject to the produce safety rule.</p>

                              <div class="fs-acc-desc" style="display: none;">
                                <p>Remember that, unlike traditional facility inspections, FSVP inspections are based on the review of records, rather than observations of food production. While most of the FSVP inspections will be at the importer’s place of business,  the FDA may also request that some importers provide FSVP records to FDA electronically, or through other means that deliver the information quickly.

</p>
                                  <p>In either case, the investigator will ask to view the importer’s FSVP records to determine if there are deficiencies. In most cases, if any deficiencies are found, the importer will be provided an opportunity to correct them. the focus right now is on supporting compliance, except for problems that pose a danger to health or reflect intentional disregard for legal responsibilities.</p>
                                  <p>Importers should expect an approach that is interactive, the investigators will be asking questions about what they see and there will be the opportunity for a real dialogue. it is encouraged that importers try to keep the lines of communication open with FDA if problems are found, allowing for the correct action to be taken. If a corrective action is needed, the importer should communicate clearly what actions will be taken and by what date the corrections will be completed.
